\# Python Software Engineer Assignment



This project demonstrates a smart Python assistant using LLM APIs, tools, and agentic thinking. The project is structured across three levels:
\## Level 1: LLM-Only Smart Assistant



\### How to Run



1\.  Make sure you have a Python virtual environment set up and activated.

2\.  Install the necessary dependencies:

    ```bash

    pip install google-generativeai

    ```

3\.  Set your Gemini API key as an environment variable.

4\.  Run the chatbot script:

    ```bash

    python chatbot.py

    ```



\## Level 2: LLM + Basic Tool Use



\### How to Run



1\.  Ensure the virtual environment is active.

2\.  Run the chatbot with tool integration:

    ```bash

    python chatbot\_with\_tool.py

    ```



\## Level 3: Full Agentic AI with Multi-Step Tasks



\### How to Run



1\.  Ensure the virtual environment is active.

2\.  Run the full agent script:
